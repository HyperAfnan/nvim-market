# nvim-market
An extension market place plugin for neovim.
Made for personal use, but feel free to fork/contribute/extend anyway you like.

### NOTE:
- The code is extremely ugly (Just nearly 200 LOC).
- Just a PoC until real packspec stuff gets standardised. (refer: https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim/pull/910, https://github.com/neovim/packspec)

### TODO
- [ ] Cleanify keybinds, create setup, etc
- [ ] Make UI good, add highlight, etc
- [ ] interactive `opts` update
